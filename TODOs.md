Next:
- Get AHI4/Developer/examples/Low-level/HardDiskRecord compiling and try fixing AHIST_S32S recording in it
- Fully split Recording + Playback parts in AHI to allow 1 client each
- Recording overflow handling similar to playback underrun handling
- Calibration of all audio sources' volumes with each other
- Calibrate volume AHI Mono vs Stereo
- Mixer UI elements and their responsiveness
- Get MHI implemented as per https://bitbucket.org/supernobby/mhimdev/src/main/
- Get mpeg.device working as per https://aminet.net/package/mus/play/dmdev

Done:
- Test 32/24bit recording as AHIST_S32S in AHIRecord -> Failed
